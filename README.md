# IITMadrasPythonCodeBase
This is a repository containing all the Python codes to important questions in assignments (both PPAs and GrPAs), Practice Tests and Programming exams in the IIT Madras Online B.Sc. Degree course. Easy questions have not been included in this repository.

**Also, most of the code demonstrated in the video lectures can also be found in the CodeFromLectures folder.**

**Solutions of CodeChef Practice Contests (specifically conducted for IITM BSc Students) are also added here within the "Programming exam codes Folder".**
