#Dynamic Typing - In python, the data type of a variable is flexible or dynamic. It can change with respect to what type of value is assigned to it.
a=10
print(type(a))
a='India'
print(type(a))
n=10
print(type(n))
n=n/2 # The moment we use division operator, python changes data type of variable to float
print(type(n))
